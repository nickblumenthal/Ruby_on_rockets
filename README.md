# Ruby On Rockets

This is a clone of Ruby on Rails central functionality.  It allows users to follow convention to rapidly create a lightweight app.  Metaprogramming is utilized to properly route requests to the appropriately named controllers and then render the results via ERB.  It's kind of like building a robot to build more robots.

## Some cool features

- Cookie based notification system featuring both immediate and post page load notifications.
- Link and button helpers to automatically generate the html.
